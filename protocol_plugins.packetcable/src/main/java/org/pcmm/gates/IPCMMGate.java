 * A PacketCable Multimedia Gate is a logical representation of a policy

 * access by a single IP flow to enhanced QoS Services provided by a DOCSIS
 * cable network. Gates are unidirectional; a single Gate controls access to a
 * flow in either the upstream or the downstream direction, but not both. For a
 * bi-directional IP session, two Gates are required, one for upstream and one
 * for downstream, each identified by a unique GateID. It is important to
 * recognize that this is a fundamental difference from PacketCable 1.x, in
 * which a single GateID may reference both an upstream and a downstream Gate.
